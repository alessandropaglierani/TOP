		 <h3>Description</h3>
		 <p>
		 	This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-
		 	from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more 
		 	traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but 
		 	my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and 
		 	Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy 
		 	green salad and crusty garlic bread.
