    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This corned beef brisket recipe was given to my mother-in-law and it has become a treasured family recipe. The
        brisket is seared in a hot skillet, then topped with sliced onions, garlic, and a drizzle of broth, and braised
        for about 6 hours for a tender, juicy roast. It's so worth the wait! You have never had corned beef like this
        and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef. I serve it with
        colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish
        dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year round.
